# CO2-Emission-Dashboard

## Interactive [visualization dashboard](https://miguelhermar.github.io/CO2-Emission-Dashboard/) in Python with Panel

In this project I focus on creating an interactive dashboard using an open-source Python library called [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/), taking CO2 Emissions Data that go from 1750 to 2021.

The dashboard may take up to 1 minute to fully load all the data.
